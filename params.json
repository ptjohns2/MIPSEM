MIPS32 asm programs can be mapped to a custom file format which can be mapped to MIPSEM's 32-bit addressable virtual memory system.  The virtual CPU can then execute instructions from memory by using a decoded instruction cache to speed up execution.  This results in no additional instruction decoding overhead within loops or consecutively called function calls.  Cache coherency is also implemented in the instruction decoder cache to make sure that self modifying MIPS32 code can be written.   \r\n   \r\n>The GUI written using the Qt framework allows editing of multiple MIPS32 assembly files at once via tabs.  Includes a syntax highlighter which can be customized to the user's liking.  Using the F5 hotkey attempts to assemble the object file, and if successful this also executes it using the MIPSEM_CORE executable, the cross platform MIPS32 assembly emulator.  \r\n\r\n>MIPSEMobj programs can be run by hand using its CLI by passing it one argument: the directory of the MIPSEMobj file you want to execute.\r\n\r\n>The assembler has helpful error messages to aid in debugging with an output console allowing you to click on the error and be brought to the file and line where the error occurs.  \r\n   \r\nUses only Qt and the C++ standard library.
