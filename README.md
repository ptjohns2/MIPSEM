MIPSEM (C++)  

Assembler, disassembler, and emulator for MIPS32 assembly.  Enables the encoding and decoding of all MIPS32 instructions.  Planned for emulation of a virtual MIPS32 CPU.  
  
Implements numerous data structures for optimization such as:  
	-Hash table based instruction encoding  
	-Binary search tree based instruction decoding  
	-Cache for the most commonly decoded instruction types  

A work in progress.
