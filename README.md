MIPSEM

MIPS32 assembler, disassembler, and emulator written in C++.  A work in progress, intended to be a useful tool for students learning MIPS32 assembly to use as a light weight command line alternative to the more popular MIPS32 emulation environments such as MARS and SPIM.

Progress:
Instruction encoding
Instruction decoding

TODO:
Macro support
.asm file cleanup
Emulation of instructions
